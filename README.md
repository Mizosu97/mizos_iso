# mizos_iso
ISO image for mizOS systemd.

# About

This is the source code to the mizOS ISO image, made with [archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archiso).

If you don't want to compile the ISO yourself, I have the precompiled ISO hosted on mega.nz. Get it [here](https://mega.nz/file/7qwXnIBC#rtwgyYBGI4qWIbu1eiJ1Dd72PDdvGFS70vjSzxSQZRY).

# Build

You need a machine running Arch Linux or one of its derivatives to build the ISO.

To build the ISO, run `./compile`.

This process may take a while depending on your machine.

The built ISO will appear in the `out` folder.
